# GlyphsSDK

These are Xcode Templates for making plugins for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/).

### Installation

Copy the `Glyphs Dev` folder into `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/`.

In Xcode, you can then create a new project with *File > New > Project > Cross-plattform ...*. When Xcode asks you to choose a template for your new project, select *Glyphs Dev* in the sidebar and choose the plugin type you like. You can give your plugin a name in the screen that follows.
